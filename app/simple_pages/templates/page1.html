                    Docker is an open source platform that is great for developing and running applications
                </p>
                    It is an absolute gem when it comes to saving time because you can ship, test and deploy same time
                </p>
                    Whats so unique about Docker is that you can run an application in an isolated environment
                <p>
                    By running your application in siolation you can test as much as you can and they are lightweight
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to applications in docker, they are actually containers, which can be viewed easily
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another great feature is that you can easy share your containers with others
                </p>
                <p>
                    All you colleagues have to do is to work on code locally and share it with your teammates
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Docker you will experience reliable and consistent delivery
                </p>

                    Docker ia based of the client - server relationship
                </p>

                </p>
                    One of the unique features of Docker is daemon, whoch listens on API and does all the lifting
                <p>
                    Users interact with daemon via Docker client carrying out requests like "docker ps" and others
                </p>
                <p>
                    Docker also has the Docker Desktop which is utilized for sharing and building apps aka containers
                </p>
                <p>
                    Containers get build by images which act like a template or guide on what container to build
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can always rely on the "docker ps" command to check up on what containers run for you
                </p>
