                    <p>
                        Thank you for joining me today. In this article I would like to cover the object-oriented
                        programming,
                        also known as OOP and other concepts like encapsulation and more. When it comes to OOP you have
                        automatically think of the 4 main principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and
                        abstraction.
                        Lets now go over these principles in details.
                    </p>

                            <h2><u>Encapsulation</u></h2>

                        <div class="col boarder">
                        Encapsulation - is when data encapsulates an object.Encapsulation protects data like
                        methods
                        and variables within an object to be alternated and keeps
                        them in a separate "department", for example, you have two sharepoint folders that are one
                        for
                        accounting and the other is for underwriting. You would have those folders completely
                        separated
                        from each other where people from accounting only can access the accounting folder and
                        underwriting
                        only has access to the underwriting folders.For example in the calculator_test.py there is a
                        code
                        "calc1 = Calculator() and calc2 = Calculator()" which demonstrates an encapsulation and
                        classes being
                        used independently with independent results to them.

                        <div class="col boarder">
                            Lets know go over the inheritance. When inheritance is introduced into code it eliminates
                            the child-parent
                            relationship and allows you to include multiple classes into one object. Benefits of the
                            inheritance is that it displays real-world
                            relationships and allows us to reuse the code inherit any subclasses related to any
                            classes being inherited.

                        </div>
                        <div class="col boarder">
                            Now, lets go over the polymorphism. Overall, polymorphism is when one function
                            name can work on many other shapes or forms and will depend on type of object that
                            triggers
                            it.
                            It can exist with a class method and even inheritance. If we look at our code you can
                            find
                            polymorphism
                            the ".result" which we will call for any calculation where in this case it will be addition,
                            subtraction etc.

                        </div>
                        <div class="col boarder">
                            Abstraction is used to hide data that is not necessary for a user to know
                            and see. For example, when you use a self-check out in store, you would follow the
                            prompt to
                            complete
                            your purchase, but you do not need to know how the self-checkout hardware processes
                            your
                            purchase.
                            Another reason to use abstraction is to simplify and focus more on the purpose of a
                            class,
                            which
                            will optimize the overall performance of your code and not overwhelm it with extra
                            data.

                            I would like to also introduce you to instantation. Instantation - is a process
                            where you will take
                            a class and turn it into an object. If we look back at our code, in the
                            calculator_test.py file we
                            can find the instance "assert isinstance(calculator, Calculator)" which asserts
                            here
                            for calculator
                            class to turn into an object.

                        <div class="col boarder">
                            The whole purpose
                            of a class is to put functions together and make them work as one unit where
                            class will act
                            like a blueprint
                            from where object will be derieved from. You may easily spot a class in a code where
                            one
                            of them is
                            located in the
                            calculator/_init_.py - "class Calculator:" which is a calculator class which
                            will command
                            many other
                            methods like adding, subtracting, getting results and more.

                            data
                            and set of

                            be performed on that particular data set. Additionally, an object is
                            characterized by a
                            number of

                            these

                            We can find a line of code: calculator = Calculator()
                            where we are instantiating the calculator class (Calculator () ) and by doing
                            so

                            (calculator_test.py)where from calculator is the

                            Lets now visit a property. Property is a variable that will stay
                            with a
                            class and once it performs
                            it will stick to the code as an end result. Properties can be static
                            and
                            instance, where with static
                            you will have a single value that will be used for the entire class
                            and
                            with the instance you will have a copy of a
                            particular property value for singular instance of the class we are
                            working with. The great way to
                            identify a property is to look for a class which will be attached
                            for a
                            particular class. In our code
                            you can find it in the calculator/_init_.py file as "result = 0".

                            calculator. In order
                            to test something you need to mimic the environment that you are

                            an addition value and testing it for a "1" checking later if
                            that
                            value will appear.
                            Overall, the purpose of the fixture is to

                            pytest, without it there would nothing to look/reference to within

                            Method is a function that will be located
                            within a particular class. It is a function that may operate
                            without a class but once it
                            joins under a
                            class it turns into a method. There are two types of
                            methods,
                            static and instance. When it
                            comes to static
                            method or the word static, you do not instantiate it and
                            will
                            only use it when you need to
                            create just a
                            single instance of lets say, an instance of subtraction and
                            with
                            the instance method will
                            work on each
                            individual project and use the "self" to call for a
                            particular
                            class we work at that moment.
                            You can
                            find a method example in the calculator_test.py as an "assert
                            calculator.get_result() == 0"
                            which has the ()
                            to it and is a get_result method which will lead to the
                            results
                            of your calculations ,and it
                            also has
                            methods linked to the subtraction and addition.

                            There are two more functions I would like to discuss
                            which
                            are type cast and type hint. Type
                            cast
                            converts static data, which will be a tuple list
                            into
                            dynamic which in this case it will be
                            just a
                            list. We do want to have the type cast functionality
                            because
                            it allows us to make changes to
                            our data,
                            like multiply or divide in our calculator, which is
                            a vital
                            tool to have since that is the
                            whole purpose
                            of a calculator. When it comes to python its all
                            about
                            variables and
                            return values being dynamic, where they can be
                            changed while
                            even running. This type of
                            experience
                            definitely makes coding alot more flexible but at
                            the same
                            time can introduce alot of errors
                            in production where static typing can be beneficial.
                            And
                            this is where type hinting comes to
                            play.
                            Type hinting allows for us to have an option of static
                            typing
                            to implement both worlds of
                            static and dynamic
                            typing.

                            Before we identify what is the purpose of SOLID
                            and
                            let's first simply identify what SOLID
                            stands for.
                            S - single-responsibility principle, O -
                            open-closed
                            principle, L - liskov substitute
                            principle, I -
                            interface-segregation principle and D is for
                            dependency
                            inversion principle. Overall, SOLID
                            is needed
                            to follow a set of rules and principles in
                            object-oriented design. It has been developed

                            eliminate as much technical debt as possible and
                            improve
                            testability of your code which
                            could significantly
